## Reporting an issue

If you are having issues with our code, especially if you found a bug, we want to know. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/devolo/Cockpit-open-frontend/issues). However, you should keep in mind that it might take some time for us to respond to your issue. We will try to get in contact with you within two weeks. Please also respond within two weeks if you have further inquiries.

## Requesting a feature

While we develop this frontend, we have our own use cases in mind. Those use cases do not necessarily meet your use cases. Nevertheless we want to hear about them, so you can either [create an issue](https://github.com/devolo/Cockpit-open-frontend/issues) or create a merge request. By choosing the first option, you tell us to take care of your use case. That will take time as we will prioritize it with our own needs. By choosing the second option, you can speed up this process. Please read our code style guide.
